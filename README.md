# Initial Thoughts

> This project was a great learning experience. This was definitely the most difficult react component I have ever created. It was very interesting having to design something without much knowlege of the rest of the App. I didn't want to make assumptions about what state managment tools were being used so I tried to seperate out things that were state and things that could potentially be props. While really trying to understand the design/user stories and visualizing them in a way that I hope was easily [readable](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOSNhdo8=/?invite_link_id=831681587090) by my fellow engineers

## Postives

-   Things that I feel like I leveled up on considerably was just my understanding of react & state. I honestly feel like my mastery before this project was maybe a 3/10 in base react.
-   I think since this project I've gone up to atleast a 6/7 out of 10. So No matter the result I'm extremely happy to have had this opportunity
-   I think my thought process with the design was very good I was able to clearly communicate my ideas to my mentor and even got his seal of approval
-   I've got a new interst in design. I think my tools were pretty dated to say the least (using a whiteboard), but I think I'll start investing more time into learning how to use Figma and some basic design principles
-   New respsect for production level code. I think I spent more time thinking about this design and testing things out then I did actually coding. It's truly a prcoess that requires a really analytical mind. I really enjoyed this aspect even if it wasn't perfect.
-   I feel like I did a good job mainting the repositories integrity. Creating relevant branches and making sure to avoid pushing to main.


## Negatives

-   To start the project I clearly had some knowledge gaps with react. I had used Redux in the past for state managment, but I'm not sure if Redux is really that relevant in modern design. I think the reliance on Redux led to some real issues with my base knowledge of React. Thankfully I think I turned this negative into a positive
-   Styling! Component Libraries! God Bootstrap sucks. I spent more time fighting with bootstrap than just about anything else.

## Neutral
-   I spent a lot of time practing with react and understanding state. While not a negative it definitely cost me some time to work on the main project.
-   I switched to Tailwind on Friday night and there's defintely a bit of a entry barrier regarding any new library, but I really do enjoy it and hope to continue to use it.
-   Candidly the scope of the project was a bit difficult to understand. I felt I was missing a lot of information about how things are done. Which is totally understandable, but it defintely made it a bit more difficult.

## Closing

>   As I said in the opening the entire process was a great learning experience I had highs-lows and everything in between. I plan to finish this whether its for Quantbase or just for the perfectionist in me.
